# wacuri

This REPO serves to glue together the work that is happening in the frontend app https://github.com/alexiscott/react-native-webrtc-example and it's corresponding Message broker server https://github.com/alexiscott/wacuri-api. It is  afork of https://github.com/jdmg94/react-native-webrtc-example and will remain that until it starts to take it's own life as the Wacuri App. It owes it's inspiration to https://github.com/Wacuri/wacurimvp.
